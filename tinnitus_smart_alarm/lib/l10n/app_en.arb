We would like to inform you about how we use the data in our alarm clock app, which aims to help people with tinnitus.\n\nAnonymous data storage: All data that we collect is stored anonymously. This means that no personal data is collected that can be directly traced back to you as an individual.\n\nAlarm clock sound selection: We store information about which alarm clock tone you use. This data helps us to understand which tones are most effective in improving the wellbeing of people with tinnitus.\n\nEvolution of tinnitus perception: To track progress, we also store how your perception of tinnitus, in particular the perceived loudness, evolves over time.\n\nResearch purposes and AI support: The data collected is used exclusively for research purposes. Our aim is to improve the quality of life of people with tinnitus. We also use the data to train our artificial intelligence (AI), which can generate personalized recommendations for other users based on user data.\nWe assure you that the data will be treated with the utmost care and will not be used for any other purpose. Your participation in this research is voluntary and you can withdraw your consent at any time.\n\nThank you for your trust and support in this important research work.",

  "stimuliDescription1": "The app comprises 190 differently designed auditory stimuli, which are divided into four specific categories. For each category, a gradual adjustment of the personal tinnitus frequency was realized by providing tinnitus-specific sounds for eight different tinnitus frequencies between 250 and 8000 Hz. These categories differ both in the origin of the sounds (natural or digital) and in their relation to the tinnitus (specific or non-specific).\n\n•\tnatural and specific \n•\tnatural and non-specific\n•\tdigital and specific\n•\tdigital and non-specific\n",
  "stimuliDescriptionAdditionalConsiderationsText": "The stimuli within each category were carefully selected for spectral complexity and temporal modulation to maximize the auditory experience. Examples include the simple whistle of a kettle or the complex roar of a shower, which can vary from minimal to maximal modulation depending on the stimulus. This careful selection helps to maximize the effectiveness of tinnitus treatment through acoustic stimulation.",
  "stimuliDescriptionAdditionalConsiderationsTitle": "Additional considerations",
  "stimuliDescriptionPartDigitalNotSpec": "This group includes digital sounds without a specific focus on a tinnitus frequency.They offer a wide range of sounds that provide comprehensive auditory stimulation, such as low tones and unfiltered digital noise, which can influence the perception of tinnitus in different acoustic environments.",
  "stimuliDescriptionPartDigitalSpec": "This category contains digital sounds that are tuned to individual tinnitus frequencies between 250 Hz and 8000 Hz.These sounds are designed using frequency and amplitude modulation to specifically influence the tinnitus-related listening experience, for example by generating a beeping or pulsating noise.",
  "stimuliDescriptionPartNatNotSpec": "These stimuli consist of natural sounds without specific adaptation to a tinnitus frequency.They vary in spectral complexity and temporal modulation, such as the sound of waterfalls or ocean waves, which provide general calming effects but are not directly targeted at tinnitus.",
  "stimuliDescriptionPartNatSpec": "This category includes natural sounds that are specially tuned to individual tinnitus frequencies in the range of 250 Hz to 8000 Hz in order to specifically influence the perception of tinnitus.Examples include specially modulated noise sounds that can help to effectively mask tinnitus.",
  "stimuliDescriptionPersonalizationText": "The app allows users to upload their own sounds and customize them. These personalized sounds can not only be used for tinnitus treatment, but can also be used as an alarm clock to make it easier to wake up with pleasant or familiar sounds. This function promotes personal well-being and supports a positive start to the day.",

  "welcomeText": "Welcome to the Tinnitus Smart Alarm App, specially developed for people with chronic tinnitus. Although this app is primarily intended for this target group, it can also be used as a conventional alarm clock app by people without tinnitus.\n\nOur aim is to improve your quality of life by supporting you in your daily management of tinnitus. Please note, however, that the app is not a substitute for professional medical diagnosis or treatment. It is important to always seek medical advice if you have persistent symptoms or questions.\n\nThe methods and information provided in this app are based on current scientific knowledge in the field of tinnitus and on the results of the dissertation \"Individualized Auditory Stimulation for Tinnitus: The App 'Shades of Noise'\" by Lisa Führlein. We do not conduct fundamental research on the cause or treatment of tinnitus ourselves. Our work focuses on applying existing research to provide practical solutions and support for sufferers. \n\nWe hope that our app will provide you with valuable help and make your everyday life with tinnitus easier.\n",
